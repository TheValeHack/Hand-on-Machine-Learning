We sometimes need it to check if the model we made is perform poorly because it was overfitting or because the data mismatch. We use it by take some data of the training set (this is the train-dev set) and train the model with the remaining training set. Then, we test the model accuracy using the train-dev set. If the model predicted poorly, it means the model is overfitting. If the model predicted well, we will test the model again with the train set (or set of the data inputted by users).If the model perform bad, its because the data is mismatch.
